                    <li>1/2 pound italian sausage</li>
                    <li>1 yellow onion</li>
                    <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
                    <li>36 ounces pasta sauce</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon italian seasoning</li>
                    <li>2 cups ricotta cheese</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
                    <li>1 large egg</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the lasagna noodles and cook until al dente (firm) according to package directions. Drain, rinse under cold water, and set aside.</li>
                    <li>Meanwhile, in a large skillet or Dutch oven, brown the beef, sausage, onion, and garlic over medium-high heat until no pink remains. Drain any fat.</li>
                    <li>Stir in the pasta sauce, tomato paste, Italian seasoning, ½ teaspoon of salt, and ¼ teaspoon of black pepper. Simmer uncovered over medium heat for 5 minutes or until slightly thickened. Taste and season with additional salt if desired.</li>
                    <li>In a separate medium bowl, combine 1 ½ cups mozzarella cheese, ¼ cup parmesan cheese, ricotta, parsley, egg, and ¼ teaspoon salt.</li>
                    <li>Spread 1 cup of the meat sauce in a 9×13 pan or casserole dish. Top it with 3 lasagna noodles. Layer with ⅓ of the ricotta cheese mixture and 1 cup of meat sauce. Repeat twice more. Finish with 3 noodles topped with remaining sauce.</li>
                    <li>Cover with foil and bake for 45 minutes. </li>
                    <li>Remove the foil and sprinkle the top of the lasagna with the remaining 2 ½ cups mozzarella cheese and ¼ cup parmesan cheese. Bake uncovered for an additional 15 minutes or until browned and bubbly. Broil for 2-3 minutes if desired.</li>
                    <li>Rest for at least 15 minutes before cutting.</li>
                </ol>
